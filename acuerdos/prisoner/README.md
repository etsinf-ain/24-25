# Prisoner's Dilemma with AgentSpeak and SPADE-BDI

This project simulates the classic Prisoner's Dilemma using AgentSpeak for agent logic and SPADE-BDI for agent execution in Python.

## Structure
- `prisoner1.asl`, `prisoner2.asl`: AgentSpeak code for the two prisoners
- `environment.asl`: AgentSpeak code for the environment
- `main.py`: Python SPADE-BDI runner

## How to Run
1. Ensure SPADE-BDI and dependencies are installed.
2. Run `python main.py` to start the simulation.

## To Do
- Implement detailed agent logic in `.asl` files
- Complete SPADE-BDI integration in `main.py`
